        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          All IT equipment is tracked in <strong>Snipe-IT</strong>, our IT Asset Management system.
          Every laptop, monitor, phone, and accessory has a unique asset tag. When you receive,
          return, or transfer equipment, it must be logged in Snipe-IT. This ensures we know where
          every device is, who has it, and when it needs maintenance or replacement.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <strong>📱 Why Asset Tracking Matters:</strong> In healthcare environments, HIPAA requires
          organizations to track devices that may contain or access Protected Health Information (PHI).
          Proper asset tracking helps us maintain compliance and respond quickly to security incidents.

              <ul>
                <li>Type of equipment needed (laptop, monitor, headset, etc.)</li>

              <strong>Manager approval</strong>
              <p>Your manager will receive an approval request. Standard equipment (laptop, monitor) is
                 typically auto-approved. Non-standard items (tablets, specialized hardware) require explicit approval.</p>

              <p>IT will configure the device (imaging, software installation, security settings) and
                 update Snipe-IT with the assignment. Typical lead time: 1-3 business days.</p>

        <h2>Transferring Equipment Between Employees</h2>
        <p>
          Equipment should <strong>never</strong> be passed directly between employees. All transfers
          must go through IT to ensure proper tracking:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The current holder checks the equipment back in to IT</li>
          <li>IT inspects, wipes (if needed), and reconfigures for the new user</li>
          <li>The new user checks the equipment out through the standard process</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Viewing Your Assigned Assets</h2>
        <p>
          To see what equipment is assigned to you, log in to the Snipe-IT self-service portal at
          <code>assets.yourcompany.com</code>. Your dashboard shows all checked-out assets with
          asset tags, serial numbers, and checkout dates.
